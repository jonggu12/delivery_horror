# Task ID: 5
# Title: Build Anomaly Indicators
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement visual and audio cues for anomalies in the game.
# Details:
Create a system to display anomalies such as CCTV glitches and incorrect food branding. Use Unity's particle system for visual effects and trigger audio cues when anomalies occur.

# Test Strategy:
Test the anomaly indicators in various scenarios to ensure they activate correctly and enhance player tension.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Visual Anomaly Effects [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create visual effects for different types of anomalies, such as CCTV glitches and incorrect food branding.
### Details:
Utilize Unity's particle system to design and implement visual effects that represent anomalies. Create prefabs for each type of anomaly effect and ensure they can be instantiated during gameplay.

## 2. Implement Anomaly Detection System [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop a system that detects when anomalies occur in the game.
### Details:
Create a script that monitors game events and triggers the anomaly effects when specific conditions are met, such as detecting a CCTV glitch or incorrect food branding. Use Unity's event system to handle these triggers.

## 3. Integrate Audio Cues for Anomalies [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Add audio cues that correspond to the detected anomalies to enhance player experience.
### Details:
Develop audio clips for each type of anomaly and integrate them into the anomaly detection system. Ensure that audio cues are triggered simultaneously with the visual effects.

## 4. Create Anomaly Feedback Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Implement a feedback mechanism that informs players of the detected anomalies through both visual and audio cues.
### Details:
Design a user interface element that displays a message or icon when an anomaly is detected. Ensure that this feedback is clear and enhances the player's awareness of the situation.

## 5. Test and Refine Anomaly Indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Conduct thorough testing of the anomaly indicators to ensure they function correctly and enhance gameplay.
### Details:
Create a series of test scenarios to evaluate the effectiveness of the visual and audio cues. Gather player feedback and make necessary adjustments to improve clarity and impact.
