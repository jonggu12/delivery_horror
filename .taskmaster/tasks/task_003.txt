# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Core Gameplay Mechanics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core gameplay mechanics for player interactions.
# Details:
Program the player actions for opening the door or retreating to bed based on the scenario. Use Unity's event system to handle player choices and transitions between days.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for player actions to ensure correct state changes and transitions occur.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Door Interaction Mechanic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the functionality that allows the player to open the door based on specific scenarios.
### Details:
Use Unity's event system to create a door object that listens for player input. When the player interacts with the door, check the current scenario and trigger the appropriate animation and sound effect for opening the door.

## 2. Implement Retreat to Bed Mechanic [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create the functionality for the player to retreat to bed when certain conditions are met.
### Details:
Similar to the door interaction, use Unity's event system to create a bed object. When the player interacts with the bed, check the scenario and trigger the retreat animation and sound effect. Ensure that this action updates the player's state appropriately.

## 3. Integrate Player Choice System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Set up a system to handle player choices between opening the door and retreating to bed.
### Details:
Implement a choice manager that presents the player with options based on the current scenario. Use Unity's UI system to display choices and capture player input. Ensure that the choice made affects the game state and transitions between days.

## 4. Implement Day Transition Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Create a system to manage transitions between days based on player actions.
### Details:
Develop a day manager that tracks the current day and updates it based on player actions. Use Unity's event system to trigger events at the end of each day, such as saving the game state and updating the scenario for the next day.

## 5. Test and Refine Gameplay Mechanics [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Conduct thorough testing of all implemented gameplay mechanics to ensure they work seamlessly together.
### Details:
Organize playtesting sessions to gather feedback on the core gameplay mechanics. Focus on player interactions, choice impacts, and day transitions. Use the feedback to refine mechanics and fix any identified issues.
